        "- **“My diagram shows CZ but hardware ran CNOTs.”** The transpiler decomposed CZ to native gates. That’s expected.  \n",
        "- **“Why isn’t my Bloch vector exactly on the equator?”** Numerical rounding and small imaginary parts can shift plots slightly; normalize and check phases.  \n",
        "- **“Counts aren’t exact.”** Finite sampling causes noise; increase `shots` to tighten estimates.  \n",
        "- **“CNOT control/target confusion.”** Be explicit: `qc.cx(control, target)`. Swapping them changes the operation.  \n",
        "- **“Statevector vs measurement.”** Once you measure, the simulator collapses the state. Inspect statevectors *before* measurement.\n",

        "- Single-qubit gates $X,Y,Z,H,S,T,R_\\alpha(\\theta)$ act as rotations on the Bloch sphere.  \n",
        "- Multi-qubit gates (CNOT, CZ) enable entanglement; many gates interconvert via conjugations.  \n",
        "- Composition/decomposition and depth/width are practical concerns for NISQ.  \n",
        "- Visual tools (circuit drawers, Bloch plots) are essential for debugging and intuition.  \n",
        "- These notions underpin quantum feature maps, kernels, and variational layers in AI/DS.\n",
