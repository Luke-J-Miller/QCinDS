# Quantum Circuits & Gates

## Description: 
Exploration of quantum circuits as sequences of operations on qubits, focusing on single- and multi-qubit gates. Students will build and visualize circuits in Qiskit.
## Key Concepts/Subtopics: 
Single-qubit gates (X, Y, Z, Hadamard, S, T); controlled gates (CNOT, CZ); circuit composition and decomposition; Bloch sphere representation; quantum circuit diagrams. Quantum vs classical computing overview, Introduction to IBM Qiskit platform, Qiskit environment setup and basic circuit simulation, First quantum circuits: creation and execution
## Learning Objectives: 
Identify and apply basic quantum gates; construct multi-qubit circuits; visualize gate effects using Qiskit tools.
## Suggested Resources: 
Qiskit documentation tutorials on quantum circuits; Hands-on guide to quantum programming with Qiskit.
