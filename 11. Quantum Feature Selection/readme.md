# Introduction to Feature Selection

## Definition: 
Select subset of relevant features to improve ML model performance
## Goals:
- Reduce dimensionality, computation cost
- Improve model accuracy, reduce overfitting
- Enhance interpretability


## Classical Methods:
- Filter: Statistical measures (e.g., correlation, mutual information)
- Wrapper: Model-based selection (e.g., recursive feature elimination)
- Embedded: Integrated with model (e.g., LASSO)


## Quantum Potential: 
- Leverage quantum parallelism for faster, richer selection
## AI Relevance: 
Critical for high-dimensional datasets (e.g., genomics, images)

# Quantum Mutual Information

## Classical Mutual Information (MI):
- Measures dependency: ( $I(X;Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y)$ )
- H: Entropy, ( $H(X) = -\sum p(x) \log p(x)$ )
- Used to select features correlated with target


## Quantum Mutual Information:
- For quantum states $ρ_X, ρ_Y: ( I(X;Y) = S(ρ_X) + S(ρ_Y) - S(ρ_{XY})$ )
- $S(ρ)$: von Neumann entropy, ( $S(ρ) = -Tr(ρ \log ρ)$ )


## Quantum Advantage: 
Captures entanglement-based correlations
## Computation: 
Requires density matrix estimation, challenging on NISQ
## Application: 
Identify features with high quantum correlation to labels

# Quantum Feature Maps for Selection

## Role: 
Encode classical features into quantum states for analysis
## Types (from QSVM):
- ZZ Feature Map: Entangling rotations, e.g., ( $e^{-i (x_i - x_j)^2 Z_i Z_j}$ )
- Pauli Feature Map: Combines X, Y, Z rotations


## Selection Strategy:
- Map features to qubits
- Compute MI or kernel-based metrics between feature states and target
- Select features with highest relevance


## Advantage: 
Quantum maps capture non-linear, entangled relationships
## Challenge: 
Noise in feature map circuits affects selection accuracy

# Quantum Mutual Information Estimation

## Process:
- Encode feature $x_i$ and target $y$ into quantum states $|ψ(x_i)⟩, |ψ(y)⟩$
- Compute joint state $ρ_{XY}$ (e.g., via feature map)
- Estimate entropies: $S(ρ_X), S(ρ_Y), S(ρ_{XY})$
- Calculate $I(X;Y) = S(ρ_X) + S(ρ_Y) - S(ρ_{XY})$


## Circuit Approach:
- Use swap test for state overlap to estimate density matrices
- Example: Overlap ( $Tr(ρ \sigma) = |\langle \psi | \phi \rangle|^2 $)


## NISQ Issue: 
Requires many measurements, noise-sensitive
## AI Context: 
Selects features with quantum-enhanced correlations

# Hybrid Quantum-Classical Approaches

## Workflow:
- Quantum: Compute kernel matrix or MI for feature-target pairs
- Classical: Rank features, select top-k using classical criteria
- Train ML model (e.g., QSVM, classical SVM) on selected features


## Hybrid Benefits:
- Quantum: Rich feature representations
- Classical: Robust selection algorithms (e.g., RFE, LASSO)


## Example: 
Use quantum kernel to score features, then classical SVM
## Advantage: 
Reduces quantum circuit depth, leverages classical efficiency
## ML Pipeline: 
Preprocessing step before training classifiers
