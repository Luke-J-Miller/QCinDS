# Recap from Session 4

## Key Points:
### Query model: 
Access input via oracles (black-box functions)
### Deutsch-Jozsa: 
Constant vs. balanced, $O(1)$ quantum vs. $O(2^n)$ classical
### Bernstein-Vazirani: 
Find hidden string, $O(1)$ quantum vs. $O(n)$ classical
### Quantum advantage: 
Superposition queries and interference


## Connection to Today: 
Grover's algorithm extends query model to search problems, leveraging amplitude amplification
## Question: 
How might query-based algorithms $N = 2^n$ items, find one (or more) items satisfying a condition (e.g., $f(x) = 1$) using an oracle
### Classical Approach:
- Check items sequentially
#### Expected queries: 
$O(N)$ (average $N/2$ for one solution)


### Quantum Goal: 
Reduce query complexity significantly
### Real-World Analogy: 
Finding a specific record in an unsorted database (no index)
## Relevance to AI: 
Search for optimal parameters, rare patterns in data, or anomalies

# Grover's Algorithm Overview

Proposed by Lov Grover (1996): Quantum algorithm for unstructured search
## Input: 
Oracle $O_f$ where $f(x) = 1$ for target item(s), $0$ otherwise
## Output: 
Index x where $f(x) = 1$ with high probability
## Key Insight: 
Amplify probability of correct solutions via iterative process
## Query Complexity: 
$O(\sqrt{N})$ vs. classical $O(N)$ → quadratic speedup


## System: 
Process: Grover's algorithm uses quantum mechanics to amplify the amplitude of the target state, allowing for fewer queries than classical methods.

# Grover's Algorithm Steps

## High-Level Steps:
1. Initialize $n$ qubits in uniform superposition: ( $|s\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{x=0}^{N-1} |x\rangle$ )
2. Apply Grover iteration $O(\sqrt{N})$ times:
3. Oracle query: ( $O_f |x\rangle \to (-1)^{f(x)} |x\rangle$ ) (flips phase for solutions)
4. Diffusion operator: Inverts amplitudes about the mean
5. Measure to obtain solution x with high probability


## Intuition: 
Each iteration boosts amplitude of target states while suppressing others
## Circuit Structure: 
Repeated oracle-diffusion pairs
## AI Context: 
Searches high-dimensional spaces (e.g., feature selection)

---

# Grover’s Oracle

## Function: 
Marks solutions by phase inversion
For target $x*$, ( $O_f |x*\rangle = -|x*\rangle$ ); else ( $|x\rangle$ ) unchanged


## Implementation: 
Unitary operator, often as multi-qubit controlled-Z
Example for $n=2$, target $x*=11$: Oracle flips phase of $|11⟩$


## Matrix Form: 
Diagonal matrix with $-1$ for solution states, $1$ elsewhere
## Role: 
Identifies solutions without revealing $f(x)$ internals
## Challenge: 
Constructing efficient oracles for practical problems (e.g., SAT, database search)

---

# Diffusion Operator

## Purpose: 
Inverts amplitudes about their mean to amplify target states
## Construction: $D = H^{\otimes n} (2|0\rangle\langle0| - I) H^{\otimes n}$ 
1. $H$: Hadamard gates on all $n$ qubits
2. $2|0⟩⟨0| - I$: Phase inversion for $|0⟩^n$ state


## Effect: 
Boosts amplitude of marked states, suppresses others
## Geometric View: 
Reflection over average amplitude vector in state space
## In Qiskit: 
Implemented using multi-qubit controlled-Z and Hadamards
## Key Property: 
Enhances quantum interference for speedup

# Grover Iteration and Amplitude Amplification

## One Iteration: Oracle + Diffusion
- Oracle marks solutions with negative phase
- Diffusion amplifies marked states’ amplitudes


## Amplitude Dynamics:
- Initial state: Equal superposition, amplitude $\approx  1/\sqrt{N}$
- Each iteration: Target amplitude grows as $\approx  \sin((2k+1)θ)$, where $θ ≈ \arcsin(1/\sqrt{N})$


## Visualization: 
State vector rotates toward solution in 2D subspace
## Outcome: 
After $\approx  \sqrt{N}$ iterations, target state dominates
## AI Application: 
Amplifies rare solutions in optimization (e.g., hyperparameter tuning)

# Quadratic Speedup

## Optimal Iterations: 
$\approx π\sqrt{N/4}$ for one solution \\
Derived from angle θ and rotation geometry


## Speedup Proof:
### Classical: 
$O(N)$ queries (linear search)
### Quantum: 
$O(\sqrt{N})$ queries (optimal per lower bounds)


## Significance: 
Quadratic improvement, provably optimal for unstructured search
## Limitations: 
Still exponential in n (but square root better); oracle cost critical
## Example: 
N=16 (4 qubits), $\approx 4$ iterations vs. $\approx 8$ classical queries (average)

---

# Handling Multiple Solutions

## Case: 
### $M$ Solutions ($1 ≤ M ≤ N$):
Oracle marks all M solutions
### Optimal iterations: 
- $\approx π\sqrt{(N/M)/4}$ 
- Probability of measuring a solution remains high


## Adjustment: 
- Fewer iterations needed as $M$ increases
- If $M$ unknown: Estimate via quantum counting (uses phase estimation)


## Circuit Modification: 
Oracle designed for multiple targets
## Practical Note: 
In Qiskit, simulate with $M$ marked states for labs
## Data Science Use: 
Find multiple anomalies or clusters in datasets

# Grover’s Circuit

## Structure:
1. Initialize: $H^{\otimes n}$ on input qubits, $H|1⟩$ on auxiliary
2. Repeat $\approx \sqrt{N}$ times: $[O_f]--[D]$
3. Measure input qubits


## Diagram (n=2, one iteration):
- $|0> --[H]--•--[H]--[Z]--[H]-- Measure$
- $ \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \; \; \ | $
- $|0> --[H]--⊕--[H]--[Z]--[H]-- Measure$
- $|1> --[H]--[O_f]--$


## Oracle Example: 
For $x*=11$, multi-controlled $Z$ gate
## Diffusion: 
Controlled-$Z$ with all controls, surrounded by $H$ gates
