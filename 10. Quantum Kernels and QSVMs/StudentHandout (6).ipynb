We review classical kernel methods, build quantum feature-map circuits, derive the quantum-kernel estimator, and show how to train a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) in Qiskit Machine Learning.  Mini-exercises with short answers appear at the end.\n",

        "- **“Can I reuse shots across pairs?”** No—each $U_\\phi^\\dagger(x_i)U_\\phi(x_j)$ needs its own circuit; but batching on hardware reduces calibration overhead.  \n",
