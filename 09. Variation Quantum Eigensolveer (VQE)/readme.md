# Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)

## Description: 
Study of VQE for finding ground states of molecular Hamiltonians, with ties to quantum chemistry and optimization.
## Key Concepts/Subtopics: 
Ansatz circuits (e.g., UCCSD); expectation value computation; classical optimizers (SPSA, COBYLA); hybrid quantum-classical workflow; Qiskit Nature integration.
## Learning Objectives: 
Build VQE circuits; integrate with classical optimization; apply to simple molecules or Ising models.
## Suggested Resources: 
Qiskit Machine Learning tutorial on VQE; Variational algorithms in IBM docs.
