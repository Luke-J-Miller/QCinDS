# Intro to Quantum Computing & Qiskit

## Description: 
This session introduces the fundamental differences between classical and quantum computing, including concepts like qubits, superposition, and quantum measurement. Students will set up Qiskit and run their first quantum circuit on a simulator.
## Key Concepts/Subtopics: 
Classical bits vs. qubits; basic quantum states (Dirac notation); quantum parallelism; installing Qiskit and using IBM Quantum Experience; creating a simple quantum circuit with measurement. Quantum states, superposition, measurement, Dirac notation and Hilbert spaces, Qubit representation and Bloch sphere, Quantum mechanics postulates overview
## Learning Objectives: 
Understand the motivation for quantum computing; install and configure Qiskit; execute a basic quantum program.
## Suggested Resources: 
IBM Quantum Learning platform for introductory courses; Qiskit YouTube tutorial on introduction and hands-on setup.
