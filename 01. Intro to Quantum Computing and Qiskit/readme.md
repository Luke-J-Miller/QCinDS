# Motivation for Quantum Computing

## Challenges in Classical Computing:
- Exponential complexity in problems like factoring (RSA security), molecular simulation, optimization
- AI bottlenecks: Training large models, searching vast datasets


## Quantum Advantages:
- Exponential state space: ( n ) qubits represent ( 2^n ) states
- Speedups: Polynomial or quadratic for specific problems
- Applications in Data Science/AI: Quantum ML for high-dimensional data, optimization for logistics/neural nets


## Historical Context:
- Feynman (1982): Simulate quantum systems with quantum computers
- Shor (1994), Grover (1996): Key algorithms
- Current Era: NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices



# Current Landscape of Quantum Computing

## Hardware Providers: 
IBM (superconducting qubits), Google (Sycamore), IonQ (trapped ions), Rigetti
## Quantum Supremacy: 
Google's 2019 claim; debated, but highlights potential
## Software Ecosystems: 
Qiskit (IBM), Cirq (Google), PennyLane (Xanadu for ML)
## Challenges: 
Decoherence, error rates, scalability (current ~100-1000 qubits)
## Relevance to AI: 
Quantum kernels for SVMs, variational circuits for NNs
## Timeline: 
Practical quantum AI expected in 5-10 years (as of 2025)

# Classical Computing Fundamentals

## Bits and Gates:
- Bit: Binary state (0 or 1)
- Logic Gates: NOT, AND, OR; reversible/irreversible
- Computation: Deterministic, sequential/parallel


## Linear Algebra View:
- State as vector: Bit 0 = 
$$ \begin{pmatrix} 1 \ 0 \end{pmatrix} $$
- Gates as matrices: NOT = $ \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} $


Limitations:
No inherent parallelism beyond classical limits
Exponential time for certain problems (e.g., traveling salesman)



Slide 6: Transition to Quantum Computing

Key Principles from Quantum Mechanics:
Wave-particle duality, uncertainty principle
But focus on computational aspects: States as vectors in Hilbert space


Quantum vs. Classical:
Probabilistic vs. deterministic outcomes
Unitary (reversible) operations only
Measurement collapses state


Mathematical Framework:
Hilbert Space: Complex vector space with inner product
States: Normalized vectors ( |\psi\rangle ), ( \langle \psi | \psi \rangle = 1 )



Slide 7: Qubits: The Building Block

Definition:
Qubit: Unit vector in 2D complex Hilbert space
General State: ( |\psi\rangle = \alpha |0\rangle + \beta |1\rangle ), ( |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1 )


Basis States:
( |0\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \ 0 \end{pmatrix} ), ( |1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \ 1 \end{pmatrix} )


Superposition:
Linear combination: Allows representing multiple states
Example: Equal superposition ( |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle + |1\rangle) )


Physical Realizations: Electron spin, photon polarization, superconducting loops

Slide 8: Superposition in Depth

Theoretical Insight:
Superposition arises from linearity of Schr√∂dinger equation
Enables quantum parallelism: Operate on all basis states at once


Multi-Qubit Systems:
Tensor Product: 2 qubits ( |\psi\rangle \otimes |\phi\rangle )
State Space: Dimension ( 2^n ) for n qubits


Example:
3 qubits: 8 basis states, coefficients for each


Implications for Computing: Algorithms exploit interference to amplify desired outcomes

Slide 9: Quantum Measurement

Postulate:
Measurement in basis ( {|0\rangle, |1\rangle} ): Outcomes 0 or 1 with probabilities ( |\alpha|^2, |\beta|^2 )
Collapses wavefunction: Post-measurement state is the outcome eigenvector


Born Rule: Probability = squared amplitude
Ensemble Interpretation: Repeat experiments to estimate probabilities
Mathematical Representation:
Projectors: ( P_0 = |0\rangle\langle0| ), expectation ( \langle \psi | P_0 | \psi \rangle = |\alpha|^2 )


Challenge: Irreversibility; no cloning theorem prevents copying states

Slide 10: Quantum Parallelism

Concept:
Apply unitary operation U to superposition: U acts on all components simultaneously
Example: Compute f(x) for all x in superposition


Deutsch's Algorithm Insight:
Determine if function is constant or balanced with one query (vs. classical multiple)


Limits:
Measurement yields one result; need clever extraction (e.g., interference)


AI Tie-In: Parallel evaluation in feature spaces for ML kernels

Slide 11: Introduction to Quantum Gates

Unitary Operators:
Gates: 2x2 unitary matrices (preserve norms)
Example: Hadamard H = ( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \ 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} ) creates superposition


Reversibility: All quantum gates are invertible (U^\dagger U = I)
Preview of Session 2: Single-qubit (X, Y, Z, H) and multi-qubit gates (CNOT)

Slide 12: Overview of Qiskit

Role in the Course: Framework for implementing quantum circuits (hands-on in labs/HW)
Key Features:
Python API: Build circuits with QuantumCircuit class
Simulators: Aer for classical simulation (statevector, density matrix)
Backends: Access IBM quantum hardware via cloud


Basic Workflow:
Create circuit, apply gates, measure
Execute on simulator/hardware, analyze results


Setup Note: Detailed instructions in provided materials; install via pip

Slide 13: Theoretical Example: Simple Circuit

Conceptual Circuit:
1 qubit, apply H gate, measure
Initial: |0\rangle
After H: ( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|0\rangle + |1\rangle) )
Measurement: 50% |0\rangle, 50% |1\rangle


Matrix Form:
State evolution: H |0\rangle = superposition vector


Discussion: No code here; implement in HW 0

Slide 14: Quantum Computing in AI Context

Quantum Machine Learning (QML):
Use quantum states for data encoding
Algorithms like QSVM leverage kernel trick in quantum space


Hybrid Approaches: Combine quantum subroutines with classical ML
Potential Impact: Exponential speedup in training or inference for certain models

Slide 15: Challenges and Open Questions

Decoherence: Qubits lose coherence quickly (~ms)
Error Correction: Needs many physical qubits per logical qubit
Scalability: From NISQ to fault-tolerant quantum computers
Theoretical Limits: BQP complexity class; not all problems sped up
