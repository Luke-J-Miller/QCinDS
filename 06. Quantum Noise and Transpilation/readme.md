# Quantum Noise & Transpilation

## Description: 
Examination of real-world quantum hardware challenges, including noise models and circuit optimization via transpilation.
## Key Concepts/Subtopics: 
Types of quantum noise (decoherence, gate errors); error mitigation techniques; transpiler passes in Qiskit (optimization levels); simulating noisy backends.
## Learning Objectives: 
Model quantum noise in simulations; use Qiskit transpiler to optimize circuits; evaluate circuit performance under noise.
## Suggested Resources: 
IBM Quantum documentation on noise and performance enhancement.
