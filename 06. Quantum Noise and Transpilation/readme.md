# Introduction to Quantum Noise

## What is Quantum Noise? 
Unwanted interactions between qubits and environment or imperfect gates
## Impact: 
Distorts quantum states, reduces algorithm accuracy
## NISQ Era (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum):
Current devices (e.g., IBM, Google) have limited qubits and high error rates
Noise limits circuit depth and fidelity


## Why Study Noise? 
Essential for practical quantum computing, especially in data science applications
## Goal: 
Model, mitigate, and optimize to achieve reliable results

---

# Types of Quantum Noise

## Decoherence:
- Loss of quantum information due to environment
- T1 (Relaxation): Qubit decays from $|1⟩$ to $|0⟩$ (energy loss)
- T2 (Dephasing): Loss of phase coherence, randomizes relative phases


## Gate Errors:
- Imperfect gate operations (e.g., CNOT errors)
- Causes: Control pulse inaccuracies, crosstalk


## Measurement Errors: 
Incorrect readout (e.g., $|0⟩$ read as $|1⟩$)
## Thermal Noise: 
- Environmental fluctuations affecting qubits
- Example: In Grover, noise may flip marked states or reduce amplitude amplification

# Noise Models in Quantum Computing

## Pauli Noise Model:
### Simplest model: 
Random $X, Y, Z$ errors with probabilities
### Example: 
After gate, apply $X$ with probability $p_x$


## Depolarizing Noise:
Replaces state with completely mixed state with probability $p$
### Matrix: 
$ρ → (1-p)ρ + pI/d$


## Thermal Relaxation: 
Models T1/T2 using exponential decay
## Coherent Errors: 
Systematic gate miscalibrations (e.g., over-rotation)
## Modeling in Qiskit: 
Aer noise module simulates realistic hardware noise
## Relevance: 
Accurate noise models critical for simulating ML circuits

# Impact of Noise on Quantum Algorithms

## Circuit Depth Sensitivity: 
Longer circuits (more gates) accumulate more errors
## Grover’s Case: 
$O(√N)$ iterations increase noise with $N$
## Fidelity Decay: 
Output state deviates from ideal; lower success probability
## In AI Context:
- Quantum neural networks (QNNs): Noise distorts variational parameters
- QSVM: Kernel estimation errors reduce classification accuracy


## Challenge: 
Balance circuit depth with noise tolerance in NISQ devices
## Discussion: 
How does noise affect quantum advantage in data science?

---

# Error Mitigation Techniques

## Goal: 
Reduce noise impact without full error correction (requires many qubits)
## Techniques:
- Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE): Run circuit at different noise levels, extrapolate to zero noise
- Readout Error Mitigation: Calibrate measurement errors using confusion matrix
- Probabilistic Error Cancellation: Add inverse noise operations statistically
- Dynamical Decoupling: Insert idle-time pulses to reduce decoherence


## Qiskit Tools: 
Ignis for error mitigation experiments
## Limitations: 
Increases runtime or sampling; not a full solution
## Application: 
Enhances reliability of quantum kernels in ML

# Transpilation in Quantum Computing

## Definition: 
Process of transforming a quantum circuit into an equivalent one optimized for specific hardware
## Why Transpile?
### Hardware constraints: 
- Limited qubit connectivity, native gates
- Reduce gate count and depth to minimize noise


## Key Steps:
- Map circuit to hardware topology (qubit connectivity)
- Decompose gates to native set (e.g., CNOT, single-qubit rotations)
- Optimize: Merge gates, cancel redundancies


## Qiskit Transpiler: 
- Converts high-level circuit to executable form
- Example: Swap qubits to match hardware, reduce CNOTs

---

# Qiskit Transpiler Passes

## Optimization Levels (0-3 in Qiskit):
- Level 0: No optimization, basic mapping
- Level 1: Light optimization (merge gates)
- Level 2: Moderate (commute gates, reduce swaps)
- Level 3: Heavy (advanced rewriting, noise-aware)


## Key Passes:
- Layout Pass: Assigns logical qubits to physical qubits
- Routing Pass: Inserts SWAPs for connectivity
- Gate Optimization: Reduces gate count (e.g., $H-H → I$)
- Noise-Adaptive Layout: Chooses least noisy qubits/gates


## Trade-Off: 
Higher optimization increases compilation time
## AI Relevance: 
Optimized circuits improve QNN or QAOA performance

# Simulating Noisy Backends in Qiskit

## Aer Noise Model:
- Simulate real hardware noise (T1, T2, gate errors)
- Example: Import noise profile from IBM Quantum device


## Process:
- Define circuit (e.g., Grover’s)
- Apply noise model via Aer’s NoiseModel
- Simulate with QASM simulator
- Analyze results (fidelity, success probability)


## Theoretical Insight: 
Compare ideal vs. noisy outcomes
## Use Case: 
Test quantum ML algorithms under realistic conditions

## Note: 
Labs will implement noisy simulations
