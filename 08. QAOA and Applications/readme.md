# QAOA & Applications

## Description: 
Introduction to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for solving combinatorial optimization problems.
## Key Concepts/Subtopics: 
MaxCut and other NP-hard problems; variational parameters; mixer and cost Hamiltonians; optimization loops in Qiskit; applications in data science (e.g., graph partitioning).
## Learning Objectives: 
Formulate problems for QAOA; implement and tune QAOA circuits; evaluate performance against classical solvers.
## Suggested Resources: 
Qiskit optimization tutorials; Qiskit Machine Learning building blocks.
