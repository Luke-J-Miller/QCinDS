# MaxCut Problem

## Definition: 
Given graph $G = (V,E)$ with weights $w_{ij}$, partition vertices into two sets to maximize sum of edge weights across sets
## NP-Hard: 
Exact solution exponential; approximation algorithms exist
## Cost Function: $C = ∑{ij∈E} w{ij} z_i z_j$, where $z_i = ±1$ (partition labels)
## Quantum Formulation: 
Map to Ising model; maximize expectation of cost Hamiltonian
## Example:

## Data Science Use: 
Graph partitioning for clustering, community detection

# QAOA Algorithm Steps

## Steps:
1. Initialize n qubits in superposition: |+⟩^n = H^{\otimes n}|0⟩^n
2. Apply p layers of:
   - a. Cost unitary: U(C,γ) = e^{-iγH_C}
   - b. Mixer unitary: U(B,β) = e^{-iβH_B}
3. Measure to sample solutions
4. Classically optimize parameters $γ$, $β$ to maximize $⟨H_C⟩$


## Parameters: 
$γ_k$, $β_k$ for $k=1,...,p$ ($p$ is circuit depth)
## Output: 
Approximate solution with high probability
## Intuition: 
Alternates problem-specific evolution and mixing

# Cost Hamiltonian (H_C)

## Definition: 
- Encodes problem objective as quantum operator
- For MaxCut:
-- $H_C = ∑{ij∈E} w{ij} Z_i Z_j / 2$
-- $Z_i$: Pauli-Z on qubit $i$ (eigenvalues $±1$)
-- Maps $z_i = ±1$ to quantum states $|0⟩, |1⟩$


## Unitary: 
- $U(C,γ) = ∏{ij∈E} e^{-iγ w{ij} Z_i Z_j / 2}$
- Implemented via ZZ rotations (R_ZZ gates)


## Expectation: 
$⟨ψ|H_C|ψ⟩$ approximates classical cost $C$
## Role: 
Drives state toward optimal solutions
## AI Example: 
Represents graph-based cost in clustering

---

# Mixer Hamiltonian ($H_B$)

## Purpose: 
Ensures exploration of solution space, prevents trapping in local minima
## Standard Choice: 
$H_B = ∑_i X_i$ (transverse field)
## Eigenstates: 
$|+⟩^n$ (superposition)


## Unitary: 
- $U(B,β) = ∏_i e^{-iβ X_i} = R_X(2β)^{\otimes n}$
- Implemented via single-qubit X rotations


## Effect: 
Rotates state to mix amplitudes across basis states
## Analogy: 
Simulated annealing’s exploration in classical optimization
## Data Science Context: 
Enables sampling diverse solutions in feature optimization

# Variational Parameters and Optimization

## Parameters: 
$γ = (γ_1,...,γ_p), β = (β_1,...,β_p)$
## Objective: 
Maximize $⟨H_C⟩ = ⟨ψ(γ,β)|H_C|ψ(γ,β)⟩$
## Classical Loop:
- Run quantum circuit with current $γ, β$
- Measure expectation via sampling
- Update parameters using classical optimizer (e.g., COBYLA, SPSA)


## Depth ($p$): 
Higher $p$ improves approximation but increases noise
## Challenge: 
Barren plateaus (vanishing gradients for large $p$)
## ML Connection: 
Similar to training neural nets with gradient descent
