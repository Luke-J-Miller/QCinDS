# Entanglement & Bell States

## Description: 
Discussion of quantum entanglement as a key resource in quantum computing, with hands-on creation of Bell states and exploration of their properties.
## Key Concepts/Subtopics: 
EPR paradox; Bell inequalities; creating entangled states (e.g., Bell pairs); measuring correlations; applications in quantum teleportation and superdense coding.
## Learning Objectives: 
Explain entanglement and its non-classical nature; generate and manipulate entangled states in Qiskit; demonstrate Bell state measurements.
## Suggested Resources: 
IBM Quantum tutorials on advanced quantum information; Introductory Qiskit notebook examples from community tutorials.
