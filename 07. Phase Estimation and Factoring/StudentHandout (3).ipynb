You will learn how the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) extracts eigen-phases, how Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) leverages repeated powers of a unitary, and how Shor’s algorithm wraps QPE to factor integers.  We also discuss noise-related challenges and AI/DS links. Mini-exercises with short answers appear at the end.\n",
